## Shrimadhav U K

My primary operating system is Arch Linux, with only the softwares that I require!

My main machine is a [HP15-R007TX](http://amzn.in/daBG4tF), with the deafult hardware configurations. I use i3 as my Window Manager. ZSH is my terminal shell, and Atom is my main text editor, though I often use VIM in places where there is no monitor attached to the device.

This directory contains the configuration files for:
- i3 Window Manager
- Atom Text Editor
- VIM Text Editor
- ZSH Terminal Shell
