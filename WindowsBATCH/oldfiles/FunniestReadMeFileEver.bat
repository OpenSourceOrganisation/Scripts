echo     Once upon a time there was a printer who lived in the woods.
echo He was a lonely printer, because nobody knew how to configure
echo     him. He hoped and hoped for someone to play with.
echo.
echo     One day, the wind passed by the printer’s cottage. “Whoosh,” 
echo said the wind. The printer became excited. Maybe the wind would 
echo be his friend!
echo.
echo     “Will you be my friend?” the printer asked.
echo.
echo     “Whoosh,” said the wind.
echo.
echo     “What does that mean?” asked the printer.
echo.
echo     “Whoosh,” said the wind, and with that it was gone.
echo.
echo     The printer was confused. He spent the rest of the day thinking and jamming paper 
echo for that is what little printers do when they are confused.

echo     The next day a storm came. The rain came pouring down, darkening the morning sky and destroying the printer’s garden. The little

echo.
echo     “Pitter Patter, Pitter Patter,” said the rain.

echo     “Will you be my friend?” the printer asked shyly.
echo.
echo     “Pitter Patter, Pitter Patter,” said the rain, and then it left and the sun came out.

echo     The printer was sad. He spent the rest of the day inside, sobbing and blinking lights cryptically

echo     “Yes,” said the printer.

echo     “What is your name?” asked the little girl.

echo     “HP 4100TN”, replied the printer.

echo     “My name is gnome-cups-manager” said the little girl.

echo     The printer was happy. He spent the rest of the day playing games and printing documents,
