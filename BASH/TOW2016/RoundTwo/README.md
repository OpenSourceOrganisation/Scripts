So you think you're a bash ninja, huh? Here is your chance to prove yourself.

Every year, all the tuxes from around the world meet at an annual conference to plan how to tackle the evil schemes of Nanosoft Corp. At the end of the conference, everyone exchanges their contact details so that they can carry out their plans after the meeting. But what usually happens is that they forget the contact information.

You are to help your fellow tux brothers by creating an Address Book program. The tux community will accept it only if it is written entirely in their favorite language, bash.

The more features you are able to add to the software, the more points to get. Here are the specifications:

You need to store the name, mobile number and email address of each contact. There could be multiple people with the same name, but the mobile number and email address will be unique.

The address book will be a menu based program which will take as an argument the file into which it will store the information. It should support insertion of a contact (10 points) and retrieval of a contacts by name (10 point), print all the contacts in alphabetical order (10), modify an existing contact (15), delete a contact (15) and check if the email address and mobile number is valid (10). You can redeem the remaining 30 points by implementing bonus features. Think of features that are both innovative and also showcase your cli-ninja skills.

- Always keep in mind that there could be multiple contacts with the same name.
- When retrieving contact information, ask the user if he wants to know the mobile number or the email address, and print only the required information.
- You can use only bash, no SQL.
- Only one file should be used for storing the information.
